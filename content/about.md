Hi! :man_technologist: I'm Doug, a full-stack software engineer based in Leicestershire, United Kingdom. I work primarily with web
technologies including:

- Node.js
- TypeScript
- Angular
- Electron
- Three.js

I enjoy designing and developing complex applications, especially those involving computational geometry and
event-driven distributed architectures. My passion is for creative software that integrates heavily with the real world.
I'm keen to challenge my skills with new languages and frameworks, and my attention has recently been drawn to Rust due
to its impact on high-performance systems programming.

Previously I worked in lighting for the arts. Some of my credits include
[Invisible Cities](https://59productions.co.uk/project/invisible-cities/) (Associate Lighting Designer / Eos Programmer)
and Yang Liping's Under Siege (Eos Programmer), as well as head of lighting for
[Kilworth House Theatre](https://www.kilworthhouse.co.uk/kilworth-house-theatre/) and the 2018
[Wexford Festival Opera](https://www.wexfordopera.com).
