            Hi! 👨‍💻 I'm Doug, a software engineer based in the United Kingdom. I
            work across the full technology stack using Node.js, TypeScript,
            Electron, and C++. My passion lies in designing and developing
            applications that integrate with the arts and entertainment sector.
        </p>

        <p class='mb-6'>
            Aside from software engineering, I have extensive experience as a
            lighting programmer and production electrician for theatre, opera,
            and contemporary dance. An overview of my previous projects can be
            found <a href='/theatre'>here</a>.
