        <p class='mb-6'>
            Hi! üë®‚Äçüíª I'm Doug, a full-stack software engineer based in the United
            Kingdom. I work across the full technology stack using Node.js,
            TypeScript, Electron, and C++.

            I enjoy designing and developing complex applications, especially
            those involving computational geometry and event-driven distributed
            architectures. My passion is for creative software that integrates
            heavily with the real world. I'm keen to challenge my skills with
            new languages and frameworks, and my attention has recently been
            drawn to Rust due to its impact on high-performance systems
            programming.
